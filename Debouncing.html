    DEBOUNCING 

- Debouncing is a technique in programming that improves the
performance of web applications by controlling the frequency at which
time-consuming tasks(Network calls / API calls) are triggered. 

- In JavaScript, debouncing is commonly used to enhance browser performance by ensuring that
expensive operations (like complex calculations, API calls, or DOM updates) are
executed only when necessary. 

- Reduces the number of times a function needs to be called. 
- Improves Performance of the web application 
-->

<!--
For Example:: -
While searching for an item in an E-Comm App , we don't want to make a separate
network call for each key press. 
- Here , Debouncing comes into picture. 
- With debouncing , we make a network call only if a specified delay happens while
pressing the key. (setTimeout()) 
- If the key is pressed continuously before the delay time ends, then debounce function will be executed from start again and the initial delay is canceled using clearTimeout()

      <!-- input.addEventListener("keyup" , getData());
      //this will make API call at each key press
      -->

      // Everytime the key is pressed, debounce function is called and if there is delay of 300ms then API call is made.
      //this will make API call only after 300ms of key press

<!-- 
const debounce = (func, delay)
Debounce function takes two arguments and makes sure the func() is not executed unnecessarily (complex operation) and it should only be executed if the specified delay happens b/w two key presses or two clicks.
If another key is pressed before this delay, then the delay is cleared .
