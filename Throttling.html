<!-- 
    THROTTLING

- Throttling limits the frequency at which a function is executed.
- Reduces no. of API calls and increases Performance 


 For Example::
- If there are multiple clicks on a button which in turn executes a function, then there will be a lot of function calls and it hampers the performance of the web app.
- By Throttling, we execute the function only after a specified timer limit.
- So, function is not executed at every click of button, but at specific intervals
- At first instance, the function is executed and then it takes a timer limit and then it executes again

<!-- 
Control with a Flag Variable: A flag variable is introduced to regulate the execution of the function, ensuring it only executes when the flag is set to true.

Closure with the Flag: The function forms a closure around the flag variable, allowing it to retain its state across multiple invocations.

Initial State Execution: Initially, the flag is set to true, allowing the function to execute on its first invocation.

Temporary Block After Execution: Once the function executes, the flag is set to false, temporarily preventing further executions until a specified delay timer completes.

Reactivation Using a Timer: A setTimeout mechanism resets the flag to true after the specified delay, enabling the function to execute again. This process continues in a cyclical manner, creating a throttled execution pattern
